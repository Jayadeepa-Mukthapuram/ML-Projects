# Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project contains a "Machine Learning model" built using "Linear Regression" to predict "car prices" based on input features.

The model is developed and trained using "Jupyter Notebook".

💾 Model Saving

The trained model is saved using "pickle" so that retraining is not required every time.

---

 📈 Output

The model predicts the "price of a car" based on the given input features with high accuracy.

🚀 Future Improvements

* Add more features for better prediction
* Try advanced regression models
* Deploy using Flask or Streamlit
